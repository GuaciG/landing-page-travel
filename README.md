# Travel Landing Page - Personal project.

It was an example of travel agency or flight search engine website.

Where I wanted to test some functionalities such as registration and login buttons, scroll button to the top or slidershow with images.

It was created from the Product landing page challenge of freeCodeCamp, made with HTML, CSS and javaScript.
