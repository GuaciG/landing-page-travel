# Travel Single Page - Personal project.

An example of single page for a travel agency or airline.

I wanted to test some functionalities such as registration and login buttons, scroll button to the top or slideshow with images.

It was made with HTML, CSS and javaScript and it came to me as an idea from the Product landing page challenge of freeCodeCamp.
